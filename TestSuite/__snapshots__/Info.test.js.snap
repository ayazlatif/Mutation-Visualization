      Welcome to the Mutation-Visualization tool. This project was created by students in CSE P 590 at the University of Washington in Spring 2019 for their class project.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Usage
    </h2>
    <p>
      Start by uploading a .json file in the prescribed format below. The tool will display a table consisting of all the mutants described in the input file and allow you to inspect the mutation and mark them as "equivalent" and/or "productive". The main page will also display overall facts about the mutants including how many have been killed, are live and are equivalent. At any time you can download the file with your changes by clicking the "Save Mutation Data" button.
